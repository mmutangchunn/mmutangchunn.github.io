Hey there, hello! Welcome!  

I'm mutangchun, a first-year graduate student in computer science who's always curious about the world of tech. Currently, my main "mission" is diving into **Image Forgery Detection**—simply put, teaching computers to be sharp-eyed detectives that see through photoshopped or AI-generated tricks in images.  

This is my personal blog, a place where I organize my thoughts, share knowledge, and occasionally vent a little. Here’s what you might find:  

*   **💡 What I’m Learning**: Mostly about **large language models (LLMs)** and **all kinds of interesting algorithms**. I’ll honestly share my study notes and the "pits" I’ve stumbled into.  
*   **🔬 What I’m Researching**: Of course, my main focus—**Image Forgery Detection**! I’ll share my thoughts on papers, research inspirations, and play-by-play实验记录 (experiment logs).  
*   **📝 What I’m Experiencing**: As a newbie in research, my **daily scientific journey** and **project experiences** (whether successful or not) will be valuable content here.  

I started this blog to push myself to reflect and think deeper. If it happens to help you out a little too, that’d be amazing!  

Feel free to look around—I hope you find something that interests you. See you in the comments section! 😊
